; ABOUT KNOWLEDGE STORTEDE AND AVAILABILITY TO 'TED':
; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
; We distinguish 3 sorts of facts
;
; - roadmap facts (about the arrangement of points and roads
;   connecting them), stored as the value of *roadmap-knowledge*;
;   they are created via the function 'def-roadmap'; the agent
;   TED is assumed to know these facts;
;
; - general facts about the world, in particular about the
;   properties of various types of entities, stored as the value
;   of *general-knowledge*; these are non-unit and/or non-ground
;   Horn clauses, typically created by 'def-object', though they
;   could also be created by explicitly pushing facts into 
;   *general-knowledge*; they are intended to allow further 
;   inferences to be drawn about the current situation, either 
;   from the perspective of the agent's beliefs (assuming the 
;   agent TED knows all the general facts), or for modelling the 
;   world as it actually is.
;
; - specific facts, i.e., ground predications (we might at some
;   point consider allowing negative ground literals as well);
;   originally sets of these were associated with particular
;   points in the road grid, but with the introduction of a
;   clear distinction between what the agent believes, and
;   what it will "notice" at a particular location, this scheme
;   has had to be changed; specific facts are now stored 
;   uniformly as *world-facts*; what the agent can observe at
;   a particular location, after each action, is separately
;   calculated, using the notion of objects that are "co-moving"
;   with another object. For example, suppose there is an apple
;   at the 'home' location initially, and the agent decides
;   to pocket it, despite not being hungry at that point. If
;   the agent now walks to another location, the facts *about*
;   the apple -- that the agent has it, that it's edible, etc.,
;   should be available at the new location -- not just as facts
;   the agent knows (which was the case in the old version) but
;   as actual facts that the actual implementation of the agent's
;   actions at that location can modify (e.g., making the apple
;   inedible, and rendering false that the agent "has" it, by 
;   eating it). We could perhaps handle this by moving facts
;   about about an object from one location to another, when the
;   object moves -- but this reqquires inference in general, and
;   seems quite cumbersome. So instead, we keep specific facts
;   in the single *world-facts* repository. (This would also make 
;   possible in future to make inferences in the world that
;   depend on facts about objects in different locations -- e.g.,
;   telephone calls, remote bank deposits, social relationships
;   between non-colocated individuals, etc.) As mentioned, the
;   new scheme requires figuring out what objects are at a given
;   location, taking account of "co-moving" objects, and then
;   making non-occluded predications about the objects at the
;   agent's location noticeable to it (so that its belief can
;   be appropriately updated). We do this with the help of user-
;   supplied list of predicates *left-comoving-preds* and *right-
;   comoving*preds*, examples of which are (is_in x y) (if x is
;   in y, then x moves with y) and (has x y) (if x has y, then
;   y moves with x). 
;
;   To deal with inferred facts, we also maintain a subset of
;   *world-facts* called *protected-facts*, which includes no
;   inferred facts.
;  
; What facts are known to TED in a given state?
; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
; It is important to note that atomic ground facts also get
; stored in state-nodes (generated in the planning process),
; as the value of the 'wffs' field of a state-node. THESE WFFS
; CAN BE VIEWED AS THE GROUND FACTS THAT TED IS AWARE OF IN THAT
; STATE. These in general include both the roadmap facts and 
; local facts (acquired by observation at the present location
; and at previously visited locations), the latter quite possibly
; elaborated through the use of general knowledge. Note that since
; state wffs are propagated from state-to-(successor)state when 
; an operator is applied -- except for changes made by that operator 
; -- THE TEDENT, TED, NEVER "FORGETS" ANYTHING IT HAS LEARNED BY 
; VISITING A POINT OR MAKING INFERENCES (except, once again, facts
; that are changed by the actions it has taken or is considering). 
;
; There is also provision for supplying some initial knowledge to
; the agent that is non-local (and not roadmap knowledge). This
; is done simply by supplying any facts we want the agent to
; know initially as part of the curr-facts argument when we
; place 'TED' at a particular initial location.
; 
; The above description of how the knowledge of TED evolves is 
; not completely accurate, because allowance is also made for 
; the possibility that the "actual" actions taken by the agent 
; have somewhat different effects from those the agent "thinks"
; they have, and also that there may be exogenous change. In 
; particular, the agent's knowledge state after performing an 
; action is recomputed (using 'notice-new-local-facts') by
; checking the agent's beliefs (current state) against locally 
; observable facts. The latter are obtained by a variant
; of the action chosen by the agent, whose name adds the
; extension '.actual' to the name of the model action assumed
; by the agent. This "actual" version may differ in its effects
; from the model version (though if no actual version is
; prespecified, a copy of the model version is used as the
; actual action). Positive locally observable facts missing
; from the agent's beliefs are added, and beliefs that would be
; locally observable if they were true, but are not in fact 
; locally present are deleted. Any new inferences that follow 
; by using *general-knowledge* are added to the *world-facts*,
; (while previous inferences are dropped), and so the agent
; may pick up some of these as well, if they are local and not
; occluded.
;
; How do we handle interaction with the user?
; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
; The default method is simply to have a function for querying the
; agent's current state, as a way of asking about its beliefs.
;
; But it would be nice to also be able to tell it something, and
; indeed to be able to "converse" with it -- and have it be aware
; THAT it is conversing, and to choose to reply voluntarily, rather
; than by unconscious, unnoticed "reflex".
;
; We could first of all have a 'listen!' function (optionally
; used prior to a 'go!') that allows us to provide certain
; questions, facts, or requests. This should directly insert the
; fact that the speech act occurred into the agent's belief state,
; and run relevant inferential updates based on that fact. The
; chief inference for a question might be that the question-asker
; wants TED to tell him/her/it an answer to the question (this is
; a simplification from a more general speech act approach); this
; will prime the agent for potentially responding accordingly. The
; agent will need to have operators for responding (i.e., satisfying
; its interlocutor's requests, or accepting knowledge). For 
; answering a question, it might have an operator 'answer-question',
; whose arguments are an interlocutor and a question. (We want 
; to potentially allow different behaviors towards different 
; interlocutors). This operator would have to handle both the 
; derivation of an answer and the verbal output. Is this even 
; possible within a non-hierarchical planning framework?
; 
; We should be able to handle this through computable effects:
; the effect is something like (say TED (answer-to? ?x)),
; where ?x is bound to the input question, and which upon evalu-
; ation becomes (say TED <some specific proposition>). Besides
; storing this effect in the agent's knowledge state as usual, 
; we would also ensure that if the questioner is the user, the
; answer is actually printed to standard-output as a side-effect
; when executing 'answer-to?'. At this point the agent should also
; make the inference that the interlocutor knows the content of
; the answer, and (perhaps!) believes that content. This should be 
; automatic from applying general knowledge to local facts that 
; are noticed -- and certainly facts about the user (like those 
; about the agent, TED) should be regarded as always being local 
; to wherever the agent is. So the one thing required here (in 
; addition to an appropriate 'answer-to?' function, of course) 
; is that facts about the user always be treated as local in 
; 'notice-new-local-facts'.
;
; 'Answer-to?' should handle both yes-no and wh-questions. The 
; unifications that check what actions are possible in a given
; state should be able to distinguish speech act descriptions that
; specify a yes-no question from ones that specify a wh-question,
; or for that matter, from ones that specify a direct request or 
; a fact. The interactive 'listen!' function should look at the 
; form of the input and decide whether to insert
;   (requests-answer User ?question), or
;   (requests-action User ?action), or
;   (offers-fact User ?fact),
; with appropriate values of the variables, of course.  
;
; ABOUT PROCEDURALLY EVALUABLE (OR AT LEAST SIMPLIFIABLE) PREDS/FUNCS:
; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
; Evaluable predicates and functions must either have names
; ending in "?", or be one of +,-,*,/,<,<=,=,>=,>.
;
; Some programs may allow for equality/inequality literals of form 
; (EQ t1 t2), or (NEQ t1 t2), but this is not used here. Instead,
; we assume that in instantiating an operator, the bindings of
; distinct variables must be distinct. However, EQ and NEQ could
; be handled using corresponding evaluable predicates eq?, neq?.

;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
; Evaluate/simplify a func/pred expression expr that may contain

; (b) arithmetic functions  +,-,*,/, or relations <,<=,=,>=,>, or
; (c) ordinary logical func/preds (i.e., ones that are interpreted 
; without being Lisp-evaluated).
;
; "Evaluation" here really means simplification, and is only
; carried out to the extent that the arguments of the outermost
; func/pred are variable-free. For example, an expression (+ 1 1 ?x)
; is not further simplified, and (+ 1 (* 2 3) ?x) is simplified 
; just to (+ 1 6 ?x). The arguments of each func/pred in expr are
; simplified if possible, and if the func/pred is evaluable and
; its arguments are variable-free, it is procedurally applied 
; to its argument before a result is returned. If it is not
; evaluable, the expr is returned unchanged except for the
; simplification of its args (if possible).
;
; Note that an expression like (loc-of Robbie) would be returned
; unchanged, whereas (loc-of? Robbie) would be evaluated, with
; the argument in effect quoted. (The world model might be accessed
; for the evaluation.) An expression like (+ 1 cost) would cause
; an error, because an attempt would be made to apply the Lisp
; '+' function to arguments 1 and 'cost. (So if 'cost' is to be
